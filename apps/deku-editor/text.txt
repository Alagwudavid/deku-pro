🖼 Central Canvas Page Frame:
make the page single-page instead of multipage
A clearly defined, resizable “page” (similar to Figma's artboard/frame).
Only components placed inside this page are considered part of the published output.
Components dropped outside the page should remain editable but not published.
 Drag-and-Drop Component should have features like Snapping, alignment guides, and resizing handles like Figma.
Users should be able to adjust the height and width of the page to fit content or design preferences.
Scrolling behaviour inside the preview should mirror how the final site will behave.
Canvas Navigation:
Pan/zoom capabilities across the canvas area.
Layers panel should manage stacking/order of components in tree like format.
Auto-saving of design progress.
Optional version history (version control) and undo/redo controls.
